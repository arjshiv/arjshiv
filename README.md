#### Work
I'm building something new! Previously, I ran product, engineering, and data at Climb Credit, where we help people up their earning potential by giving them tools to find and finance great education. Before that, I worked at BlackRock, where I focused on portfolio analytics, reporting, developer experience, and later, leading product + engineering teams creating analytics software to help companies provide better financial advice.

#### Values
Servant leadership, playing positive-sum games, helping people find their best selves.

#### Let's talk!
I've lived in multiple countries, and I love coffee, sneakers, and food. I'm always down to meet new friends, hit me up!
